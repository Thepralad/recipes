    <h3>Descriptions</h3>
    <p> A Sloppy Joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef and onions in a tomato-based sauce served on a hamburger bun.
            </p> <p>
        The sandwich likely originated in Sioux City, Iowa in the 1930s. According to legend, the "loose meat sandwich" was the creation of a cook named Joe. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>¾ cup ketchup, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir lean ground beef in the hot skillet until some of the fat starts to render, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and bell pepper; continue to cook until vegetables have softened and beef is cooked through, 3 to 5 more minutes. </li>
       
        <li>Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and garlic powder; season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. </li>
     
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade. </li>
        
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Editor's Note</h3>
    <p>If using ground beef with a higher fat content than lean, be sure to drain it before starting Step 2.</p>
